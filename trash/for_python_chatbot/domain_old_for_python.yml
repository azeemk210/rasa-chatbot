responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hi there! How can I help you with Python today?"

  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! Happy coding!"

  utter_ask_python_version:
    - text: "The latest stable version of Python is usually available at python.org. You can also check your current version by running `python --version` in your terminal."

  utter_ask_install_python:
    - text: "You can download Python from python.org. There are installers for various operating systems."

  utter_ask_help_loops:
    - text: "What kind of help do you need with loops? Are you having trouble with for loops, while loops, or something else?"

  utter_ask_help_lists:
    - text: "Lists are ordered, mutable sequences in Python. They're created using square brackets, like this: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. What specifically do you need help with?"

  utter_ask_help_dictionaries:
    - text: "Dictionaries are key-value pairs in Python. They're created using curly braces: `my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`. What's your question about them?"

  utter_ask_help_functions:
    - text: "Functions are blocks of reusable code. You define them using the `def` keyword. What do you want to know about functions?"

  utter_ask_help_file_io:
    - text: "File I/O refers to reading and writing files. Python has built-in functions for this. What are you trying to do with files?"

  utter_ask_help_packages:
    - text: "Python packages are collections of modules. You can install them using pip. What packages are you interested in?"

  utter_affirm:
    - text: "Great!"

  utter_deny:
    - text: "Okay."

  utter_default:
    - text: "I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?"

  utter_ask_python_definition:
    - text: "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more."

  utter_ask_python_syntax:
    - text: "Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. For example, to define a function, you use the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses, and then a colon. Here is a simple example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n```"

  utter_ask_python_data_types:
    - text: "Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each type has its own characteristics and use cases."

  utter_ask_python_libraries:
    - text: "Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries. Some popular ones include NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Flask and Django for web development."

  utter_ask_python_frameworks:
    - text: "For web development, popular Python frameworks include Django and Flask. For machine learning, TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to simplify development."

  utter_ask_python_use_cases:
    - text: "Python is used in a variety of fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. It is also popular for scripting and rapid prototyping."

  utter_ask_python_community:
    - text: "The Python community is very active and supportive. There are numerous online forums, user groups, and conferences where developers share knowledge and collaborate on projects."

  utter_ask_python_jobs:
    - text: "Python skills are in high demand. Job opportunities include software developer, data scientist, machine learning engineer, web developer, and automation engineer. Python is also useful for roles in finance, healthcare, and more."

  utter_ask_python_resources:
    - text: "There are many resources to learn Python, including online courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy, books like 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' and 'Python Crash Course', and the official Python documentation."
