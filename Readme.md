# Rasa Community Chatbot 🤖

This is a Rasa-powered chatbot designed to answer questions about community members based on their region and personal details. The bot dynamically reads from a CSV file containing community member information and can provide:

- Check if there are members in a specific region.
- List members from a particular region.
- Provide contact details for specific members.
